# Mini Botnet

## Description

A game where you manage a network of hacked servers to mine some bitcoin.

You can play the game directly in your browser at : https://megabattleclems.itch.io/mini-botnet

## Disclaimer

This game was made in a short time frame (first I made a prototype during a game jam, then I reworked a few thing and added some better visuals).

Therefore the code is quite ugly and there might be some bugs.
